- OpenGraph tags on all pages
- Initial sitemap covering homepage, free-estimate, services, service areas, 5 service pages, 11 city pages

---

### Phase 2 — Polish & SEO (Claude)

**Bug fixes**
- Fixed lead email: changed `sendLeadNotification()` to `await sendLeadNotification()` (was fire-and-forget, caused emails to not send on Vercel's serverless functions)
- Verified duplicate lead detection working correctly via direct DB query

**Cross-browser rendering fix**
- Diagnosed Safari vs Chrome size difference: Safari's CoreText renders `system-ui` (SF Pro) visually larger than Chrome
- Switched from `system-ui` to Inter via `next/font/google` — self-hosted at build time, zero FOUT, consistent across all browsers

**Site-wide sizing pass**
- Base font: `16px → 15px`
- Header height tuned: final `h-[104px] sm:h-[112px]`
- Nav link text: final `text-[1rem]`
- Hero H1: `clamp(38px,5.5vw,68px) → clamp(28px,4vw,50px)`
- Hero body/buttons reduced
- All section H2s: `clamp(26px,3.5vw,40px) → clamp(20px,2.5vw,30px)`
- All section subtext: `17px → 15px`
- ServiceCta: heading `text-2xl → text-xl`, button `text-lg → text-sm`
- FAQ questions on service pages: `text-xl → text-base`
- Homepage FAQ questions: `19px → 14px`

**Sitemap additions**
- Added `/contact` (priority 0.6) and `/privacy-policy` (priority 0.3)

**SEO — structured data**
- Added `LocalBusiness` + `HomeAndConstructionBusiness` JSON-LD to homepage (address, geo, hours, area served 11 cities, offer catalog 5 services)

---

### Phase 3 — Blog (Claude)

- `lib/markdown.ts` — zero-dependency pure-TypeScript markdown → HTML renderer
- `lib/blog.ts` — frontmatter parser and post reader using Node.js `fs` (no external packages)
- `/blog` listing page — category-color-coded cards, read time, publish date, CSS hover effects
- `/blog/[slug]` article pages — dark hero, breadcrumb, category tag, metadata, formatted body, inline CTA block
- Blog added to header nav (desktop + mobile) and footer
- Blog + all article URLs added to sitemap (with per-article `lastModified` from frontmatter date)
- `blog-body` CSS typography system (headings, paragraphs, lists, links, blockquotes, hr)
- 12 SEO-optimized articles at launch (see article table in [Blog section](#blog))
- `BlogPosting` JSON-LD structured data on every article page
- `article:published_time` in OpenGraph on article pages
- Twitter Card metadata on blog listing and article pages
- Canonical URLs on all blog pages
- Mobile-responsive hero padding via `clamp()` on both blog pages
- `FEATURES.md` — this document (auto-maintained going forward)
- `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` — pre-launch and post-launch task tracker

---

### Phase 4 — Observability, Bug Fixes & Polish (Claude)

**Admin dashboard — analytics bug fixes**
- Form Conversion stat card now shows "N/A" (not "0.0%") when `started=0` but submissions exist; shows "—" when no activity at all
- API returns `null` for `conversionRate` when started=0 rather than forcing 0.0
- Added subtitle to Form Funnel section clarifying that "Field Errors" = client-side form validation events (not server errors)
- Added "View all errors →" link from Recent Errors section on dashboard → `/admin/errors`

**Error observability — client-side**
- `GlobalErrorTracker` component — hooks `window.onerror` + `window.unhandledrejection`; captures unhandled JS errors and promise rejections that occur outside the React tree (setTimeout callbacks, async chains, third-party scripts). Filters benign browser noise (ResizeObserver, cross-origin script errors). Mounted in root layout.
- `app/error.tsx` — Next.js route-segment error boundary; catches errors during page/layout rendering, shows "Try again / Go home" UI, logs automatically with `digest` in metadata
- `app/global-error.tsx` — root layout error boundary (critical severity); renders its own `<html>/<body>` since root layout is gone

**Error observability — server-side**
- Added `logError()` to `/api/admin/analytics` catch block (was console.error only)
- Added `logError()` to `/api/admin/stats` catch block (was console.error only)
- Added `logError()` to `/api/admin/change-password` catch block (was console.error only)
- Added `logError()` to `/api/admin/leads/bulk` catch block (was console.error only)
- Email delivery failures now logged as `critical` / type `email_delivery` — both Resend API non-2xx responses (with status code + response body in metadata) and unexpected throws
- Turnstile `success=false` logged as `warning` / type `captcha` (includes Cloudflare `error-codes` array in metadata)
- Turnstile network errors logged as `warning` / type `captcha`
- `/api/log/error` public endpoint now persists the `metadata` field from client (was hardcoded to `null`); includes source, filename, lineno, digest, errorCodes, etc.

**Error type taxonomy** (used in `type` field across all `logError` calls)
- `client_js` — unhandled browser JS errors and React crashes
- `server_api` — unexpected throws in API route handlers
- `email_delivery` — Resend API failures
- `captcha` — Cloudflare Turnstile failures

**Email — dark mode fix**
- Added `<meta name="color-scheme" content="light">` and `<meta name="supported-color-schemes" content="light">` to lead notification email `<head>`
- Added `:root { color-scheme: light only }` CSS and `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` overrides with `!important`
- Prevents Apple Mail on iOS from auto-inverting `#1b5e35` (forest green) to lime green

**PostgreSQL raw SQL fix**
- `/api/admin/analytics` page-views-by-day query: fixed `FROM PageView` → `FROM "PageView"` (PostgreSQL requires double-quotes for mixed-case table names)
- Replaced SQLite-only `strftime('%Y-%m-%d', ...)` with PostgreSQL `TO_CHAR("createdAt", 'YYYY-MM-DD')`
- All camelCase column references double-quoted: `createdAt` → `"createdAt"`, `sessionId` → `"sessionId"`
- Cutoff value passed as a `Date` object (Prisma parameterises natively) instead of ISO string

---

### Phase 5 — Blog Pagination, Search & Category Filtering (Claude)

**Blog pagination (12 per page)**
- `lib/blog.ts` — added `POSTS_PER_PAGE = 12` constant, `getPaginatedPosts(page, perPage)` helper, `getTotalPages(perPage)` helper
- `components/BlogGrid.tsx` (new) — shared grid + static pagination controls for the `/blog/page/[n]` static direct-URL routes
- `app/blog/page/[page]/page.tsx` (new) — static paginated pages for pages 2, 3, etc. Uses `generateStaticParams()` to pre-render all pages at build time. Redirects `/blog/page/1` → `/blog`. 404s on out-of-range pages. Sets `robots: { index: false }` on non-page-1 pages (SEO best practice)
- Pagination URLs: `/blog` (page 1), `/blog/page/2`, `/blog/page/3`, etc. — auto-generated as articles are added

**Blog search + category filtering**
- `components/BlogFilters.tsx` (new) — `"use client"` component; all post metadata serialized from server at build time (lightweight — titles/descriptions only, no full content, no API call at runtime)
- **Search input**: live-filters by title, description, and category as you type; resets to page 1 on each keystroke
- **Category pills**: 6 color-coded pill buttons (one per category); active pill fills with the category's brand color; click again to deselect
- **Clear button**: appears when any filter is active; resets both search query and selected category
- **Filtered mode**: when any filter is active, shows all matching posts in one list with match count; no pagination (typical filtered set is <12)
- **Unfiltered mode**: client-side pagination (Prev/Next + numbered page buttons, 12/page)
- No new npm dependencies — plain `String.prototype.includes()` matching (more than adequate for 100+ articles)
- `app/blog/page.tsx` — refactored: hero + CTA remain server-rendered; passes all posts to `BlogFilters` for client-side interactivity

---

## Backend & API

### Lead Submission (`POST /api/lead`)
1. Validates all fields (name, phone 10-digit, email, address, city, service, Turnstile token)
2. Verifies Cloudflare Turnstile token server-side
3. Checks for duplicate lead: same `phoneDigits` OR `email` submitted within last 24 hours
4. Stores lead in PostgreSQL with generated `leadId`
5. Creates `LeadEvent` audit record (`CREATED` or `DUPLICATE_FLAGGED`)
6. Sends email notification via Resend (includes duplicate warning banner if flagged)
7. Returns success or field-level validation errors as JSON

### Error Logging
Three endpoints write to `ErrorLog`:
- `POST /api/log/error` — client-side errors (unhandled JS, React crashes, global error tracker). Accepts: severity, type, message, stack, path, metadata (JSON)
- `lib/logError.ts` — server-side utility called directly from API route catch blocks

**What is logged:**
- Unhandled browser JS errors (`window.onerror`) — type `client_js`
- Unhandled promise rejections (`window.unhandledrejection`) — type `client_js`
- React component tree crashes (`ErrorBoundary.componentDidCatch`) — type `client_js`
- Next.js route-segment render errors (`app/error.tsx`) — type `client_js`, severity `error`
- Root layout crashes (`app/global-error.tsx`) — type `client_js`, severity `critical`
- API route unexpected throws (`/api/lead`, `/api/admin/*`) — type `server_api`
- Email delivery failures (Resend non-2xx or throw) — type `email_delivery`, severity `critical`
- Cloudflare Turnstile failures — type `captcha`, severity `warning`

### Admin Auth
- Session-based authentication via HTTP-only cookie
- `bcryptjs` for password hashing
- Login/logout via `/api/admin/login` and `/api/admin/logout`
- All `/admin/*` routes and `/api/admin/*` routes are auth-protected

### CSV Export (`GET /api/admin/leads/export`)
- Exports all leads as a properly formatted CSV
- Columns: ID, Name, Phone, Email, Address, City, Service, Details, Status, Created, Notes

## Email

**Provider:** Resend

### Lead Notification Email
- Sent to site owner on every new lead submission via Resend
- HTML email template with: name, phone (formatted, click-to-call link), email, address, service, details
- **Duplicate warning banner** displayed prominently if lead flagged as duplicate (same phone/email within 24h)
- **Photos attached** to email when submitted (up to 5, base64-encoded)
- "View Lead in Admin →" button linking directly to the lead detail page
- `await`ed before response so Vercel serverless function doesn't shut down before send completes
- **Delivery failures** logged as `critical` severity in `ErrorLog` (type `email_delivery`)
- **Dark mode safe** — `<meta name="color-scheme" content="light">`, `<meta name="supported-color-schemes" content="light">`, and `:root { color-scheme: light only }` prevent Apple Mail on iOS from inverting the forest green header to lime green

## Security

### CAPTCHA
- **Cloudflare Turnstile** on the Free Estimate form
- Token verified server-side before any lead processing

### Admin Authentication
- HTTP-only session cookie (not accessible to JS)
- Passwords stored as `bcryptjs` hashes
- All admin routes and API endpoints check session before responding

### Duplicate Lead Detection
- Checks `phoneDigits` AND `email` against leads created in the last 24 hours
- Flags duplicate in DB and email — does not silently discard

### Error Logging & Observability
- `GlobalErrorTracker` captures all unhandled browser JS errors and promise rejections
- `ErrorBoundary` catches React component tree crashes
- `app/error.tsx` and `app/global-error.tsx` handle Next.js route/layout-level crashes
- Server-side: all API route catch blocks call `logError()` — persistent DB record with severity, type, message, stack, path, IP, user agent, metadata
- Email delivery failures logged as `critical` — ensures missed lead notifications are detectable
- Turnstile failures logged as `warning` — repeated warnings can indicate bot activity or misconfigured key
- All errors viewable at `/admin/errors` with severity/type filters
